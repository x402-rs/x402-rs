# Scheme: `exact`

## Summary

`exact` is a scheme that transfers a specific amount of funds from a client to a resource server. The resource server must know in advance the exact
amount of funds they need to be transferred.

## Example Use Cases

- Paying to view an article
- Purchasing digital credits
- An LLM paying to use a tool

## Appendix

## Critical Validation Requirements

While implementation details vary by network, facilitators MUST enforce security constraints that prevent sponsorship abuse. Examples include:

### SVM

- Fee payer safety: the fee payer MUST NOT appear as an account in sensitive instructions or be the transfer authority/source.
- Destination correctness: the receiver MUST match the `payTo` derived destination for the specified `asset`.
- Amount exactness: the transferred amount MUST equal `maxAmountRequired`.

### Stellar

- Facilitator safety: the facilitator's address MUST NOT appear as transaction source, operation source, transfer `from` address, or in authorization entries.
- Authorization integrity: auth entries MUST use `sorobanCredentialsAddress` only, MUST NOT contain sub-invocations, and expiration MUST NOT exceed `currentLedger + ceil(maxTimeoutSeconds / estimatedLedgerSeconds)` (fallback to `5` seconds).
- Transfer correctness: `to` MUST equal `payTo` and `amount` MUST equal `requirements.amount` exactly.
- Simulation verification: MUST emit events showing only the expected balance changes (recipient increase, payer decrease) for `requirements.amount`—no other balance changes allowed.

Network-specific rules are in per-network documents: `scheme_exact_svm.md` (Solana), `scheme_exact_stellar.md` (Stellar), `scheme_exact_evm.md` (EVM), `scheme_exact_sui.md` (SUI).
