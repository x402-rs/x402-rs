# Exact Payment Scheme for Concordium (`exact`)

This document specifies the `exact` payment scheme for the x402 protocol on Concordium.

This scheme facilitates payments of a specific amount of CCD or PLT on the Concordium blockchain using sponsored transactions (V1).

## Scheme Name

`exact`

## Protocol Flow

The protocol flow for `exact` on Concordium is client-driven with facilitator sponsorship.

1.  **Client** makes a request to a **Resource Server**.
2.  **Resource Server** responds with a payment required signal containing `PaymentRequired`. The `extra` field in the requirements contains a **feePayer** which is the account address of the identity that will sponsor (pay fees for) the transaction. This is typically the facilitator. (On Concordium, this is the transaction **sponsor** account.)
3.  **Client** fetches its own account nonce from the Concordium network.
4.  **Client** constructs a sponsored transaction containing a transfer to the resource server's wallet address for the specified amount, with the facilitator set as the sponsor.
5.  **Client** signs the transaction with their wallet (sender signature only). The sponsor signature slot remains empty.
6.  **Client** serializes the signed transaction to JSON.
7.  **Client** sends a new request to the resource server with the `PaymentPayload` containing the serialized partially-signed transaction.
8.  **Resource Server** receives the request and forwards the `PaymentPayload` and `PaymentRequirements` to a **Facilitator Server's** `/verify` endpoint.
9.  **Facilitator** deserializes the transaction and inspects it to ensure it is valid and contains the expected payment parameters.
10. **Facilitator** returns a `VerifyResponse` to the **Resource Server**.
11. **Resource Server**, upon successful verification, forwards the payload to the facilitator's `/settle` endpoint.
12. **Facilitator Server** adds its sponsor signature and submits the now fully-signed transaction to the Concordium network.
13. **Facilitator Server** waits for ConcordiumBFT finalization (~10 seconds deterministic finality).
14. Upon successful on-chain settlement, the **Facilitator Server** responds with a `SettlementResponse` to the **Resource Server**.
15. **Resource Server** grants the **Client** access to the resource in its response.

## `PaymentRequirements` for `exact`

In addition to the standard x402 `PaymentRequirements` fields, the `exact` scheme on Concordium requires the following inside the `extra` field:

```json
{
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "ccd:9dd9ca4d19e9393877d2c44b70f89acb",
  "amount": "1000000",
  "asset": "CCD",
  "payTo": "4FmiTW2L4RvCsSVTjFAavYvrgnPLGNj43eiwPYmbhNqtAcMbWW",
  "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "extra": {
    "feePayer": "3JzqJH2FqYk9J8HjX3rJ6cH2xw6sQJ5dXfLw2v7Uo5W8x9Qk2s"
  }
}
```

- `asset`: Identifies the payment asset for this transaction.
  - `"CCD"`: Native CCD. This is the default.
  - Token symbol (e.g., `"EURR"`): PLT token identified by its registered symbol.
- `extra.feePayer`: The account address of the facilitator fee payer (Concordium sponsor) that will sponsor the transaction fees.

Notes:
- On Concordium, PLT tokens have unique registered symbols; this scheme uses the registered symbol as the `asset` identifier.

### Network Identifiers

Concordium uses CAIP-2 format with the `ccd` namespace:

| Network | CAIP-2 Identifier |
|---------|-------------------|
| Mainnet | `ccd:9dd9ca4d19e9393877d2c44b70f89acb` |
| Testnet | `ccd:4221332d34e1694168c2a0c0b3fd0f27` |

### Asset Format

| Asset Type | Format       | Example  |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Native CCD | Token symbol | `"CCD"`  |
| PLT Token  | Token symbol | `"EURR"` |

### Amount Format

All amounts are expressed in the smallest unit (atomic):

| Asset Type | Unit | Decimals | Example: 10 CCD / 5 EURR |
|------------|------|----------|---------------------------|
| Native CCD | microCCD | 6 | `"10000000"` |
| PLT Token | Smallest subunit | depends on token | `"5000000"` |

## PaymentPayload `payload` Field

The `payload` field of the `PaymentPayload` contains:

```json
{
  "signedTransaction": { ... }
}
```

- `signedTransaction`: The JSON-serialized V1 sponsored transaction object, containing the sender's signature but with an empty sponsor signature slot.
- `sender`: (Optional) The sender's Concordium account address (base58). Redundant with `signedTransaction.header.sender`.

The `signedTransaction` is a V1 transaction with:
- `signatures.sender` populated (client's signature)
- `signatures.sponsor` empty (facilitator adds during settlement)

Facilitators MUST treat `signedTransaction.header.sender` as the source of truth.

  "payer": "3kBx2h5Y2veb4hZvAE2c1Zr6DYJwWbPr9xQJJBPWyFnXHF9UuN"
}
```

## Facilitator Verification Rules (MUST)

A facilitator verifying an `exact`-scheme Concordium payment MUST enforce all of the following checks before sponsoring and broadcasting the transaction:

1. Transaction version

- The transaction MUST be version `1` (V1 sponsored transaction format).
- The transaction MUST deserialize successfully from JSON into a valid V1 sponsored transaction.

2. Sender identity

- `transaction.header.sender` MUST be a valid Concordium account address (base58).

3. Sponsor identity

- `transaction.header.sponsor.address` MUST match the address provided in `PaymentRequirements.extra.feePayer`.
- The facilitator MUST NOT sponsor transactions that name a different sponsor.

4. Transfer destination

- For native CCD (`asset` is `"CCD"`): the `toAddress` in the simple transfer payload MUST equal `PaymentRequirements.payTo`.
- For PLT tokens: the `recipient` in the token update operations MUST equal `PaymentRequirements.payTo`.

5. Amount (exact match)

- For native CCD: the transfer `amount` MUST equal `PaymentRequirements.amount` (in microCCD).
- For PLT tokens: the transfer `amount` MUST equal `PaymentRequirements.amount` (in smallest token units).

The exact scheme requires a strict equality check. Transactions with amounts greater than or less than the required amount MUST be rejected.

6. Asset type

- For native CCD: the transaction MUST be a `SimpleTransfer` or `SimpleTransferWithMemo` type.
- For PLT tokens: the transaction MUST be a `TokenUpdate` type, and the `tokenId` MUST correspond to `PaymentRequirements.asset`.

7. Transaction expiry

- `transaction.header.expiry` MUST be in the future.
- `transaction.header.expiry` MUST NOT exceed the current time plus `PaymentRequirements.maxTimeoutSeconds`.

8. Sender signature

- `transaction.signatures.sender` MUST contain at least one credential signature.
  The sender's credential signature(s) MUST be verified cryptographically against the sender's on-chain account credentials. The facilitator MUST fetch the sender's account information from the Concordium network and validate that the signature was produced by a key authorized for the sender account.

9. Transaction payload safety

- The transaction MUST contain exactly one transfer operation (no bundled or unexpected operations).
- The facilitator's sponsor address MUST NOT appear as the sender, recipient, or authority of the transfer.

These checks are security-critical to ensure the sponsor cannot be tricked into paying gas for unintended transactions. Implementations MAY introduce stricter limits (e.g., shorter expiry caps) but MUST NOT relax the above constraints.

Facilitators MUST also ensure the transaction is likely to succeed on-chain by simulation or targeted preflight checks that include at a minimum ensuring nonce/sequence validity and sufficient sender balance for the transfer.
