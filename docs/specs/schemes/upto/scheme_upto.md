# Scheme: `upto`

## Summary

`upto` is a scheme that authorizes a transfer of up to a **maximum amount** of funds from a client to a resource server. The actual amount charged is determined at settlement time based on resource consumption during the request.

This scheme is ideal for usage-based pricing models where the final cost is not known until after the resource has been consumed.

## Example Use Cases

- Paying for LLM token generation (charge per token generated)
- Bandwidth or data transfer metering (charge per byte transferred in a single request)
- Dynamic compute pricing (charge based on actual resources consumed)

## Core Properties (MUST)

The `upto` scheme MUST enforce the following properties across ALL network implementations:

### 1. Single-Use Authorization

Each authorization MUST be settled at most once. After settlement (regardless of amount), the authorization is consumed and cannot be reused.

- Rationale: Provides a clear audit trail, simpler mental model, and matches x402's request-response pattern.
- Implementation: On EVM, Permit2's nonce mechanism enforces this. Other networks MUST implement equivalent replay protection.

### 2. Time-Bound Authorization

Each authorization MUST have explicit validity time constraints:

- **Start time** (`validAfter`): Authorization is not valid before this timestamp
- **End time** (`deadline`): Authorization expires after this timestamp

- Rationale: Limits exposure window for unused authorizations and ensures timely settlement.
- Implementation: On EVM, Permit2's `deadline` and witness `validAfter` enforce this. Other networks MUST implement equivalent time bounds.

### 3. Recipient Binding

The authorization MUST cryptographically bind the recipient address. The server/facilitator cannot redirect funds to a different address than what the client signed.

- Rationale: Prevents malicious facilitators from stealing funds.
- Implementation: On EVM, the Permit2 witness pattern binds `witness.to`. Other networks MUST implement equivalent recipient binding.

### 4. Maximum Amount Enforcement

The settled amount MUST be less than or equal to the authorized maximum.

- The settled `amount` MUST be `<=` the authorized maximum
- The settled `amount` MAY be `0` (no charge if no usage occurred)

## Out of Scope

The following patterns are NOT supported by `upto` and would require different schemes:

- **Multi-settlement / streaming**: Settling the same authorization multiple times (e.g., pay-per-chunk streaming)
- **Recurring payments**: Automatic periodic charges without new authorizations
- **Open-ended allowances**: Authorizations without time bounds or single-use constraints

## Network-Specific Implementation

Network-specific rules and implementation details are defined in the per-network scheme documents:

- EVM chains: See [`scheme_upto_evm.md`](./scheme_upto_evm.md)
