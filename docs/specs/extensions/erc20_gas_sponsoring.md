# Extension: `erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring`

## Summary

The `erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring` extension enables a **gasless ERC-20 approval flow** for the [`scheme_exact_evm.md`](../schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md) scheme.

Because these tokens lack native gasless approvals:

- The **Client** must sign a normal EVM transaction calling `approve(Permit2, amount)`.
- The **Facilitator** agrees to:

  - Fund the Client's wallet with enough native gas token **if the Client lacks sufficient funds**.
  - Broadcast the Client's signed approval transaction.
  - Immediately perform settlement via [`x402Permit2Proxy`](../schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md#reference-implementation-x402permit2proxy) after the approval confirms.

This flow must be executed using an **atomic batch transaction** to mitigate the risk of malicious actors front-running the transaction and intercepting funds between the Facilitator funding step and the final settlement operation.

## Usage: PaymentPayload

To use this extension:

1. The **Client constructs** a normal Ethereum transaction calling:

   ```
   token.approve(Permit2, amount)
   ```

2. The Client signs this transaction off-chain.

3. The Client inserts the **raw signed transaction hex** under:

```
extensions.erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring
```

### Client Implementation Note

The Client must ensure:

- `maxFee` & `maxPriorityFee` are aligned with the current network prices.
- `nonce` matches the current on-chain nonce of the Client wallet

Incorrect fees or nonce values invalidate the signed transaction.

## Verification Logic

Upon receiving a `PaymentPayload` containing `erc20ApprovalGasSponsoring`:

### 1. Decode the raw signed transaction

- Perform RLP decoding.

### 2. Validate transaction fields

- **Signer** matches `from`
- **`to` address** equals the `asset` contract
- **calldata** corresponds to:

  ```
  approve(spender, amount)
  ```

- **Note**: The Facilitator MUST verify that `spender` in the extension data matches the spender in the decoded transaction and matches the expected contract (e.g., [Canonical Permit2](../schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md#canonical-permit2)).

- **nonce** matches user's current on-chain nonce
- **maxFee** and **maxPriorityFee** match the current network prices

### 3. Check User Balance

- Check if the user (`from`) has enough native gas tokens to cover the transaction cost.
- If the user has enough balance, the Facilitator skips the funding step.
- If the user lacks balance, the Facilitator calculates the deficit.

### 4. Simulate the full execution sequence

The Facilitator must simulate in a single atomic batch transaction:

1. **Funding** → sending native gas token to the user (if needed)
2. **Approval Relay** → broadcasting the user's signed approval
3. **Settlement** → calling `x402Permit2Proxy.settle`

---

## Settlement Logic

The Facilitator constructs an **atomic bundle** with the following ordered operations:

1. Gas Funding: If the user has insufficient native gas, send enough native gas token to the user (`from`) to pay for gas used by the approval transaction.

2. Broadcast Approval: Broadcast the Client-provided `signedTransaction` which calls `ERC20.approve(Permit2, amount)`

3. x402PermitProxy Settlement: Call `x402Permit2Proxy.settle()`
